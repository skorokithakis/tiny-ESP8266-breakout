# Tiny ESP8266 Breakout Board

This is the tinier version of the tiny ESP8266 breakout board. I made it because
I needed something that was no larger than the 12E itself.


## Usage

You can use these ESP8266 versions with this PCB:

* ESP-07
* ESP-12
* ESP-12E
* ESP-12Q
* ESP-12F
* ESP-14


## License

Use the board however you want, it's under the BSD license, here's what it looks
like:

The files are standard KiCad files, go nuts.
